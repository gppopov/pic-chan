# pic-chan
8chan image downloader in golang. Compile and use from the console. Concurrently downloads all images from a thread by providing the url as a parameter when calling the compiled code: `pic-chan.exe http://8ch.net/pol/res/1234567.html`. Currently works only with 8ch.net threads but will add support for other chans when I have time.
